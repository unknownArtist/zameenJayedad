    <li>Find out how much you'll likely pay in closing costs. The upfront cost of settling on your home shouldn't be overlooked. Closing costs include origination fees charged by the lender, title and settlement fees, taxes and prepaid items such as homeowners insurance or homeowner's association fees. You can see what closing costs average in your area but asking Zameen Jayedad Team over the phone, chat or by emails.</li>
    <li>Look at your budget and determine how a house fits into it. Zameen Jayedad team recommends that buyers spend no more than 28% of their income on housing costs. Go much past 30% and you risk becoming house poor. Mostly people have no idea how much they are spending on their house so consultant us before you lose your savings.</li>
    <li>Talk to our real-estate agents about the real-estate climate. Do they believe prices will continue falling or do they think your area has hit bottom or will rise soon?</li>
    <li>Remember to look at the big picture. While buying a house is a great way to build wealth, maintaining your investment can be labor-intensive and expensive. When unexpected costs for new appliances, roof repairs and plumbing problems crop up, there's no landlord to turn to, and these costs can drain your bank account.</li>
</ol>

<p>So consider whether you're ready for the expense and effort of homeownership before pulling the trigger.</p>
